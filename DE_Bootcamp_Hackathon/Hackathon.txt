Hackathon


1. Objective Develop a real-time data processing pipeline to ingest, process, and visualize ad data from the click and conversion streams
2. Join the result data with existing dimensional data to derive actionable insights.
3. Data Sources 
	a. Stream 1: Ad Click Stream --> data of user when he is clicking the ads with the details of the application.
	b. Stream 2: Ad Conversions Stream --> data of a user when he is purchasing that product along with the revenue and product details.
	c. Campaigns (dim table)
	d. User Demographics(dim table)
4. Join all the a,b,c,d data as denormalized form.
5. What we need to calculate?
	a. Click-Through Rate (CTR) --> Total cliks for a perticular add/total adds genated through mock data
	b. Conversion Rate based on clicks leading to 	conversions--> counT(click_timestamp) for an 	ad_id/count(conversion_timestamp) group by ad_id
	c. Average Revenue Per Conversion --> sum(revenue) for 	each ad_id from Stream 2 / total count for that ad_id from stream2
	d. Conversion Latency (time between a click and its 	resultant conversion). --> Time difference between conversion_timestamp and click_timestamp.
	e. Trending Campaign : count(*) of conversion / count(*) of ad-click stream group by ad_id. This value will decide the trend. Compare this value with other two values and make the trend accordingly.
6. Bonus:
	a. Present the real-time metrics on a dashboard. --> Kibana,Graffana
	b. Filtering by ad campaign, date range, or platform.
	Real-time trends of CTR, Conversion Rate, etc.
	Insights into top-performing ads based on revenue and conversion rates.
