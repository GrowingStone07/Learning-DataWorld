1) Click-Through Rate (CTR) using click counts
SELECT
    ad_id,
    (count(click_timestamp) * 100.0 / (count(ad_id)) AS ctr
FROM
   Ad Click Stream 
group by ad_id ;

2) Conversion Rate based on clicks leading to conversions
SELECT
    c.ad_id,
    (COUNT(conversion_timestamp) * 100.0 / COUNT(click_timestamp)) AS conversion_rate
FROM
    Ad Click Stream as c
LEFT JOIN
    conversions con ON c.ad_id = con.ad_id
GROUP BY
    c.ad_id;


3) Average Revenue Per Conversion
SELECT ad_id ,
    SUM(revenue) / COUNT(conversion_timestamp) AS avg_Revenue
FROM
    Ad Conversions Stream
group by ad_id ;


4) Conversion Latency (time between a click and its resultant conversion).
SELECT
    c.ad_id,
    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, c.click_timestamp, co.conversion_timestamp)) AS avg_conversion_latency_MINUTE
FROM
    clicks c
JOIN
    conversions co ON c.ad_id = co.ad_id
GROUP BY
    c.ad_id;

5) Trending Campaign
SELECT
    a.ad_id,co.campaign,
    count(conversion_timestamp) AS total_conversions
FROM
    Ad Conversions Stream as a
Inner JOIN
    Campaigns as co ON a.ad_id = co.ad_id
GROUP BY
    a.ad_id
ORDER BY
    total_conversions DESC;
